Export data to DayOne app","body":"Popular private daily blogging service [Ohlife announced](http://ohlife.com/shutdown) its shutdown today.\r\n\r\n#### DayOne\r\n1. [DayOne](http://dayoneapp.com) is a solution that provides a good experience for daily loggers.\r\n2. All the data is on your local device and you can backup to your Dropbox, iCloud or any other Cloud storage\r\n3. Less dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Migrating data from OhLife to DayOne\r\n1. Unfortunately, there is no official export tool. The [OhLife export](https://ohlife.com/export) tool just gets you a single huge __*.txt__ file with all your entries.\r\n2. I wrote this script to format and import data into DayOne app.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Getting DayOne and CLI\r\n1. Install [DayOne](http://dayoneapp.com) app on Mac(_Unfortunately no Win32/Linux_) and run it.\r\n2. Go to __> DayOne__ on top bar and click on _Install Command Line Tools_ or download from [here](https://dayone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200258954-Day-One-Tools).\r\n3. The command line interface is pretty straightforward, [manual](http://dayoneapp.com/tools/cli-man/).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Importing data to DayOne\r\n1. Clone this repo.\r\n\r\n2. Help options:\r\n```\r\n$ python transfer.py --help\r\n\r\nusage: transfer.py [-h] [-d] [-f FILENAME]\r\n\r\nMigrate ohlife export data file to dayone app\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit\r\n  -d                Actually write to dayone\r\n  -f FILENAME       Filename including path to load from, by default it will\r\n                    look for data/sample.txt\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: You may need to change the formatting as per content, current output is as following:\r\n![Sample Entry in DayOne app](https://raw.github.com/adilansari/ohlife-2-dayone/master/dayone_app_sample.png)","google":"UA-55018188-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
